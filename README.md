Discount Calculator (Python)

This program calculates the final price of an item after applying a discount.
It uses a function called calculate_discount(price, discount_percent) which:

Applies the discount if it is 20% or higher

Otherwise, it returns the original price

📌 Features

Prompts the user to enter:

Original price of the item

Discount percentage

Uses control flow (if...else) to decide whether the discount should be applied

Prints the final price

🚀 How It Works

The user enters the original price (e.g., 1000)

The user enters the discount percentage (e.g., 25)

If the discount is 20% or more, the program subtracts the discount from the price.

Example: 1000 - (25% of 1000) = 750

If the discount is less than 20%, the program shows the original price.

🖥️ Example Run
Enter the original price of the item: 1000
Enter the discount percentage: 25
The final price is: 750.0

Enter the original price of the item: 1000
Enter the discount percentage: 10
The final price is: 1000.0
